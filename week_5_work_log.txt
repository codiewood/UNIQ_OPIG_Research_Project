General:
-Looked at 117 and 112 in whole non redundant data for possible MI exp
 (still none)

	Would like to:
	-Heatmap of correlations?
		*Look up pearsons/spearman and check is appro
		*get titles and labels on

General code stuff:
-Made my CDRH3 data non redundant
-One hot encoded my CDRH3 data
-Re ran plots and random forest on non redundant data
-wrote code to split data by germline

	Would like to:
	-Apply analysis to data split by family (decide which analysis)

MI:

	Would like to:
	-Manually calc MI of some positions to check code
	-Why is MI of 117 and 112 so high?? 

RF:
        Would like to:
        -Find a	way to plot feature importance with new, larger	set of vars
        -Look at patterns in this feature importance
        -Run RF	on CDRH3 set of	multiple different lengths
        -Work up to data from all lengths ?? 
	-Use my RF classifier on some data from therasabdab

Stats:
	Would like to:
	-Look at KL divergence
	-Apply a threshold to Chi and Spearmans
