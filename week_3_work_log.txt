Comparing mouse and human data:
-Took longer than anticipated to get visual representation
-Suprised by how similar they look ?
-Used 2 dif data sets of each, larger and smaller (smaller mainly to test
 code and save time)
-Picked data sets that matched as closely as possible, only different species
-Amino acids in key ordered by property (Aliphatic, aromatic, acidic,
 hyroxilic, basic, sulfur containing, amidic)

	Would like to:
	-Wanted a more thorough way to show the mouse and human are
	 different
	-Considered doing a chi-squared test with the null hypothesis that
	 there wasn't a difference in the mouse/human underlying distribution
	 however 1) limited time, wanted to look into other things and 2) the
	 chi squared test may not be accurate due to possible correlation
	 between positions.

Learning about mutual information:
-Grasped concept via online resources
-See how could be used to find out potential patterns, as can give positions
 which are 'linked' to one another in some way [X=position, x=amino acid]

	Would like to:
	-Write some kind of code to work out mutual information for the
	 position pairings and then compare to see if same relationships
	 are present in human ab and in mice ab sequences. Get freq data
	 into better format then make code to work out.
