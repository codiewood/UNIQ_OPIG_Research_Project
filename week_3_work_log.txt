Comparing mouse and human data:
-Took longer than anticipated to get visual representation
-Suprised by how similar they look ?
-Used 2 dif data sets of each, larger and smaller (smaller mainly to test
 code and save time)
-Picked data sets that matched as closely as possible, only different species
-Amino acids in key ordered by property (Aliphatic, aromatic, acidic,
 hyroxilic, basic, sulfur containing, amidic)

	Would like to:
	-Wanted a more thorough way to show the mouse and human are
	 different
	-Considered doing a chi-squared test with the null hypothesis that
	 there wasn't a difference in the mouse/human underlying distribution
	 however 1) limited time, wanted to look into other things and 2) the
	 chi squared test may not be accurate due to possible correlation
	 between positions.
