General:
-Looked at 117 and 112 in whole non redundant data for possible MI exp

	Would like to:
	-Heatmap of correlations?
		*Look up pearsons/spearman and check is appro
		*get titles and labels on
		*Is there a way to do this for MI?

General code stuff:
-Made my CDRH3 data non redundant
-Wrote code to split data by germline
-Made some plots of families in humans and mice

	Would like to:
	-Make splitting into germline code neater

MI:
-Obtained MI data of different families

	Notes/Issues:
	-No longer see such high mutual information with 112 and 117.

RF:
-One hot encoded my CDRH3 data
-Re ran plots and random forest on non redundant data. Less acc
 but only slightly so, still ~0.9

	Notes/Issues:
	-No longer have such a dependence on position 117.

        Would like to:
        -Find a	way to plot feature importance with new, larger	set of vars
	 perhaps totalling up to be only by position again?
        -Look at patterns in this feature importance.
        -Run RF	on CDRH3 set of	multiple different lengths
	-Use my RF classifier on some data from therasabdab

Stats:
	Would like to:
	-Look at KL divergence
	-Apply a threshold to Chi and Spearmans
