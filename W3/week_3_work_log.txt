Comparing mouse and human data:
-Took longer than anticipated to get visual representation
-Suprised by how similar they look ?
-Used 2 dif data sets of each, larger and smaller (smaller mainly to test
 code and save time)
-Picked data sets that matched as closely as possible, only different species
-Amino acids in key ordered by property (Aliphatic, aromatic, acidic,
 hyroxilic, basic, sulfur containing, amidic)

	Would like to:
	-Wanted a more thorough way to show the mouse and human are
	 different
	-Considered doing a chi-squared test with the null hypothesis that
	 there wasn't a difference in the mouse/human underlying distribution
	 however 1) limited time, wanted to look into other things and 2) the
	 chi squared test may not be accurate due to possible correlation
	 between positions.
	-Make my script better / more easily useable; for example importing
	 within script, recode to make output better for use as data

Learning about mutual information:
-Grasped concept via online resources
-See how could be used to find out potential patterns, as can give positions
 which are 'linked' to one another in some way [X=position, x=amino acid]
-Wrote code to work out mutual information for the different position
 pairings. Code take very long to run.
-Looked briefly at concept of entropy (characterises unpredictability of
 a variable)
-Read paper about use of MI to predict direct residue contact in protein
 to protein interactions.
	
	Would like to:
	-Figure out a way to quantify which MI values show significant
	 uncertainty reduction for each data set (threshold?) and then
	 could make a network of linked positions.
	-Calculate bound of MI using Shannen (?) entropy
	-Consider impact of sample size on MI values?
	-Optimise my code better

Learning about Random Forest:
-Read some papers on RF in bioinformatics and some course notes about
 Decision Trees and RF and how they work
-Looked briefly into one class random forest
-Looked at proximity scoring and VIMs

	Would like to:
	-Look into different computational methods of using RF
	-Look in more depth at OCRF
	-Start using RF on some data to begin figuring out what makes a
	 sequence human or not human.
