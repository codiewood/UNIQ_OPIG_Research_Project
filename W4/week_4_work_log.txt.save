General code stuff:
-Changed 'Unused' to light grey  bars for aesthetics.
-Tweaked code slightly so now only for non redundant data.
-Made code object oriented to allow easier use across dif files/scripts and
 translated this onto all still in use python scripts.
-Introduced a threshold variable  for the number of times a position should show up
 before being considered.

	Issues/Notes:
	-Not sure what to do about 'unused' positions in terms of my mutual
	 information script. If position is unused then doesn't show up in
	 the data, which means probabilities cant be properly calculated.
		-Think have fixed but use of if loops for unused case
	-MI code wont work out any mutual info for positions that just dont
	 ever show in data set (eg position 10) but don't think this is a 
	 large issue as if the position is never there, wont be able to 
	 gain any info from it anyway.
