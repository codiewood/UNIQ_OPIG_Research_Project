General code stuff:
-Changed 'Unused' to light grey  bars for aesthetics.
-With this introduction can see that some mouse  data is likely incomplete, 
 unused positions decreasing from 1 to 20 until insig.
-Tweaked code slightly so now only for non redundant data.
-Made code object oriented to allow easier use across dif files/scripts and
 translated this onto all still in use python scripts.
-Introduced a threshold variable  for the number of times a position should
 show up before being considered.

	Issues/Notes:
	-Not sure what to do about 'unused' positions in terms of my mutual
	 information script. If position is unused then doesn't show up in
	 the data, which means probabilities cant be properly calculated.
		-Think have fixed by use of if loops for unused case. But
		 unsure as to if this sol is best or if should just discount
		 unused, as unsue which unused are due to sequencing.
	-MI code wont work out any mutual info for positions that just dont
	 ever show in data set (eg position 10 for human data) but don't think
	 this is a large issue as if the position is never there, wont be
	 able to gain any info from it anyway.
	-Unsure what an appropriate threshold value would be. Tried 20 but
	 didn't seem to make much difference. Noted that position 10 still
	 shows up for Collins mouse data. Upon further investigation,
	 noted that this position shows up 56 times (likely due to error?
	 as this data has approx 31.7% of its sequences suspected to contain
	 at least 1 error and position 10 is only supposed to be present in
	 certain non-human species). ALso tried threshold 60.
